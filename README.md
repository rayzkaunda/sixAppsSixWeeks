## sixAppsSixWeeks

## Motivation

The challenge is to create six full applications in six weeks using a different framework each time. As we all know front-end development is complicated at the moment. There are a lot of tools and frameworks and it is extremely difficult to keep up with all of them. However, there are some basics that most applications need and that is why I made this repo. The apps will concentrate on the presentation layer but and a database layer.

## Week one

The first app will be using Node.js, Express, latest Bootstrap4 and Neo4j as the database.
